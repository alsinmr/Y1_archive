Archive of scripts used for Y1 MD simulation analysis


This archive provides the python scripts used to create figures in the paper:

"Fine-Tuning of the Activity of the Neuropeptide Y1 G Protein-Coupled Receptor by the Tryptophan6.48 ”Toggle Switch”"

by

Matthias Voitel, Maik Pankonin, Alexander Vogel, Anette Kaiser, Daniel Huster, Peter Hildebrand, and Albert A. Smith

This is only the Python code, in order to show how these analyses are performed. In order to run the code, it is necessary to request the MD trajectories from us.

There is NO INSTALLATION required for the provided code. Just place everything in a folder, navigate there, and run with python3. However, python3 and the following modules must be installed from other sources (these are the tested versions, although other versions may work).

Python v. 3.7.3, numpy v. 1.19.2, scipy v. 1.5.2, MDAnalysis v. 1.0.0, matplotlib v. 3.4.2

Additionally, ChimeraX must be installed and its location provided to pyDR.
